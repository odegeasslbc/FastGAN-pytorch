# A Fast and Stable GAN for Small and High Resolution Imagesets - tensorflow
fork of fastgan-pytorch converted to tensorflow

other tensorflow implementations:
* https://github.com/nguyentritai2906/FastGAN-TF.git
* https://github.com/gaborvecsei/SLE-GAN
* https://github.com/milmor/self-supervised-gan

none of them seem to work well for my use case so im continually developing this while combining ideas from existing implementations
